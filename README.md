# What is this?

This repository contains all the source for a project that I am currently working on after taking interest in <a href="https://github.com/kwsch/PKHeX">PKHeX</a>, which is a Pokemon core save editor built in C#.

I decided to build my own version of this in Javascript in the form of a website, rather than a desktop app - which PKHeX is.
